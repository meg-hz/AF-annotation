## SPF.py
This code runs the `superfamily.pl` script for a set of proteins when given a filename or a list of file names
### To Consider 
- This script and the superfamily executables folder must be in the same parent folder.
- The `superfamily.pl` script runs requires `hmmer-3.1b2`. Running this script on higher hmmer versions lead to errors
- The updated SCOP parse-able files are available [here](http://scop.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/legacy/parse/). They need to be downloaded and renamed without the version name in underscore
- This code uses a `get_fasta()` module from `PDB_modules.py`. Both files need to be present in the same folder
### Usage
**1. For a single file:**
```
python SPF.py --list <path to input dir> <protein filename>
```

**2. For a set of files:**
```
python SPF.py --list <path to input directory> <path to .txt file containing file names>
```

**3. For all files in the folder**
```
python SPF.py --all <path to input directory> 
```

The output files are added to the protein subfolders in the new/existing `result_pockets` directory present in the working directory.

---
## ScopGet.py**
This code analyzes the html output from the `Superfamily.pl` script and provides a .tsv file with file name, scop IDs

---

## PGet.py
This code runs `Fpocket`, `Sitehound` and `PocketDepth` for a single protein or a set of proteins when given a filename or a list of file names.

### To Consider 
- `Fpocket`, `Sitehound` and `PocketDepth` executable directories and the python file must be in the same parent folder
- `PocketDepth` is a 32bit executable and requires installation of appropriate architectures
  
- Note that for a batch of several proteins of large file size, `Sitehound` and `PocketDepth` take a considerable amount of time- hence it is more efficient to run the them separately rather than using this code.

### Usage
**1. For a single file:**
```
python PGet.py --list <path to input dir> <protein accession/filename>
```

**2. For a set of files:**
```
python PGet.py --list <path to input directory> <path to .txt file containing file names>
```

**3. For all files in the folder**
```
python PGet.py --all <path to input directory> 
```

The output pocket files from each pipeline are added to a new/existing directory- `result_pockets` directory present in the working directory.

---
## PComp.py
This code compares the outputs between pocket files generated by all three pipelines. It can  generate a CSV with file matching information and consensus pockets as well.

### Usage
**1. To get CSV of matched pockets:**
```
python PComp.py --txt <path to dir with pocket files>
```
This command generates a .tsv file with paths of matching pockets from all three pipelines<br> 
**2. To get .PDB files of consensus pockets:** 
```
python PComp.py --pdb <path to protein-files-dir> <path to pocket-files-dir>
```
This command creates a folder called `matches` for each protein folder and generates pocket files containing residues common between the output pocket files from all three pipelines

**Note:**
- this script is written as the next step to [[#PGet.py]] and file-handling is also considered accordingly- `pocket-files-dir` refers to the path of `result_pockets` 
- `pocket-files-dir` refers to path of the directory containing the original .PDB file of the proteins
- this code generates protein pockets for all protein folders in `result_pockets` and the output  files for each protein are stored within the folder itself

**3. To move out pockets with low confidence residues**:
```
python PComp.py --lcf <path to pocket-files-dir>
```
This creates a folder called `low_conf` within the `matches` subfolder for each protein. All consensus pocket files that contain more than 30% residues with lower than 70% confidence score are moved into `low_conf`
